== About

Learning shaders from "link:https://thebookofshaders.com/[The Book of Shaders]". Every commit on this branch has different shader.

Just practicing C++, Vulkan, and repo structuring.

Applied VMA on chapter 21, index buffer.

Added uniform buffer.

== Project Structure

single cpp, shader, CMakeLists.txt.

== Installation Dependencies

Vulkan, glfw3, glm.

== Build

To use vcpkg, remove .bak extension from vcpkg*.bak files
[source]
